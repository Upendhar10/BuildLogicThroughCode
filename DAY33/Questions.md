1. **Factorial of a Number Using Recursion**

   The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number.

   - **Input: n = 5**
   - **Output: 120 (since 5!=5×4×3×2×1)**

2. **Calculates the Power of a Number Using Recursion**

   Write a Program that Calculates the Power of a Number Using Recursion

   - **Input: base = 2, exponent = 3**
   - **Output: 8 (since 2^3 => 2 x 2 x 2 = 8)**

3. **Fibonacci Series Using Recursion**

   The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1. This program calculates the nth Fibonacci number recursively.

   - **Input: n = 5**
   - **Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3**
