   - **Output:** **`The LCM of 4 and 6 is 12.`**

2. **Write a Program to Calculate the Power of a Number:**

   Write a program that takes a base and an exponent as input and calculates the power of the base raised to the exponent using both manual calculation and the **`pow()`** function. For example:

   - **Input:** **`Base: 2, Exponent: 3`**
   - **Output:**
     ```markdown
     Result using manual calculation: 8
     Result using pow(): 8
     ```

3. **Program to Print Integers in Words:**
