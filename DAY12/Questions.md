1. **Factorial of a Number Using a For Loop:**

   Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user using a **`for`** loop. For example:

   - **Input:** **`Enter a number: 4`**
   - **Output:** **`Factorial of 4 is 24.`**

2. **Print Fibonacci Series:**

   Write a program to print the Fibonacci series up to a number **`N`** entered by the user. For example:

   - **Input:** **`Enter the number of terms: 7`**
   - **Output:** **`Fibonacci series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8`**

3. **Write a Program to Find the GCD or HCF of Two Numbers:**

   Write a program where the user enters two numbers, and the program calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) or highest common factor (HCF). For example:

   - **Input:** **`Enter two numbers: 60, 48`**
   - **Output:** **`The GCD of 60 and 48 is 12.`**
